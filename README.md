# Real-Time Stock Data Analysis and Visualization

This project implements a prototype for a real-time trading system that collects stock-related news articles, performs sentiment analysis, and streams the processed data to a Kafka topic for further analysis and visualization. Resources utilized include the book "Data Engineering" and information from DataMasteryLab.com for foundational knowledge and practical guidance.
